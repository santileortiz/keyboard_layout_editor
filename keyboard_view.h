// This is the main data structure for the keyboard, is is used to store the
// geometry and the state of the keyboard. It also implements several tools to
// be ablo to edit the geometry and make the keyboard look like the user's
// physical keyboard.
//
// Because keyboards are so different, I think that instead of providing a big
// list of possible keyboard geometries, it's better to design a small toolset
// that allows the user to move, reshape keys and assign keycodes. Several
// tradeoffs were made between flexibility and ease of use, for instance, curved
// keyboards can't be represented by this data structure as doing so would
// transform the toolset pretty much into a general vector editor, and that is
// way out of the scope of the application in terms of complexity both in
// implementation and ease of use.
//
// When we talk about a key we refer to a phisical key in a keyboard. A key that
// spans multiple rows is called a multirow key. We split multirow keys in
// rectangles that are located one per row, we call these rectangles key
// segments.
//
// The main data structure is a liked list of rows (row_t), each of which
// contains a linked list of key segments (sgmt_t). The key segments of a
// multirow key are grouped with the pointers next_multirow forming a cyclic
// linked list. In multirow keys the top segment is called the "key parent" or
// "parent segment" and is the segment that represents the full key, here is
// where the keycode will be stored.
//
// Alignment between segments of the same key is done by choosing an alignment
// mode for each segment (multirow_key_align_t). Right now we align either right
// or left edges, for a more detailed discussion of the limitations of this see
// @arbitrary_align. A segment will align its alignment mode edge with the same
// edge in the previous segment. The alignment mode of the parent segment is
// meaningless.
//
// Multirow keys are rigid, so the position of a segment in a row restricts the
// position of the other segments of the key, this means there may be some blank
// space before some of the segments of a multirow key. This distance is called
// internal glue, it's stored for each segment in the keyboard, and computed by
// kv_compute_glue(). Note that a multirow key will always have at least one
// segment (and maybe more) with internal glue equal to 0, we call such segments
// supporting segments.
//
//                              S_1's Internal
//                                    glue
//                                   /---/+---+
//                                        |S_1|
//                                   +---+|   |
//                                   |   ||S_2|  S's Supporting segment
//                                   +---++---+
//                                          S
//
// Sometimes the user may want to force there being some glue, for example to
// separate a keypad from the rest of the keyboard. To represent this, there is
// a second value called user glue. This one is stored per key, so in a multirow
// key it is located in the multirow parent. The user glue is added on top of
// the computed internal glue, which means it is defined to be the glue of the
// supporting segment(s).
//
// The toolset provided to edit the keyboard geometries was chosen to be small and
// simple, but with enough tools to be able to describe most geometries a user may
// find. Some tools work in stages, for example resize consists of a start, a
// drag and the end, on these kinds of tools an important property we ensure is
// reversibility. A tool is reversible if doing the same action in reverse, gets
// the user back to the starting position. This means that when resizing an edge
// by moving the mouse to the left, then moving the mouse to the right (without
// having ended the resize) should alow the user to get back to the initial
// state.
//
// Even though the implementation is usable, a list of things I would like to
// see implemented in the future are:
//
// - Add an undo/redo system that can be used through Ctrl+Z/Y.
//
// - Feedback on the sizes while editing things. I would like to give feedback
//   about the value that is being changed, be it the glue, width, height, etc.
//
// - Make possible to change the pointer, so we can give feedback about when the
//   left or the right, bottom or top edge is being resized. This could also be
//   used to notify about invalid segment edge resizes (@arbitrary_align).
//
// - Create a keyboard geometry file format. Something like what kv_print() does
//   but better thought out so it can also be parsed.
//
// - Read keysym_representations from a file.
//
// - A tool that allows to search the names for keycodes, to be able to create
//   geometries for keyboards we don't actually have.
//
// - Full implementation of push for edge/segment resize. Currently pushing keys
//   to the right is implemented implicitly by how kv_compute_glue() works.
//   Still more work needs to be done to make it feel more intuitive. For once,
//   we only adjust glue one step beyond where the push happens, see the test
//   case edge_resize_leave_original_pos_2() for example. A full implementation
//   would have to use a better adjust_edge_glue_info_t that stores information
//   about keys beyond a single step of visibility. Also, pushing to the left
//   is not implemented, although we have the tools to edit the glue, and the
//   left edge (kv_adjust_edge_glue(), kv_adjust_left_edge()) we are not using
//   them to fake things being pushed to the left, we need to design an
//   algorithm that detects the value and the position of changes that would
//   fake things being pushed to the left.

// An arbitrary rendering mode would need a displacement value from a fixed
// reference point in the previous segment (the left edge for example). Even
// though it "could" replace the left and right alignment modes, doing so may
// require a lot of time. When originally choosing to implement right and left
// alignment modes, I chose them because I wanted explicit detection of when two
// contiguous multirow segments make a single straight line as edge. Doing so
// avoids rendering ugly rounded corners.
//
// Now that we have settled on a fixed step size for all widths, this should
// extend to the displacement value for arbitrary alignment. Which means we
// could detect straight edges by comparisons between width and the displacement
// values, without the need for an epsilon value.
//
// Anyway, this change is non trivial because it implies changes in all complex
// parts of the code. Algorithms that would be modified include: non rectangular
// key path drawing, glue computation, size computation, key search from pointer
// coordinates, segment search from pointer coordinates, serialization and
// parsing of keyboard view string representations. Also, it's necessary to keep
// an invariant that forbids keys with disjoint segments.

    // use it. Because the widget grabs/ungrabs keyboard input we want to notify
    // the caller about it so they can show this to the user somehow in the UI.
    // These callbacks are a way to decouple this functionality between the
    // caller app and the keyboard view widget. We want this because we use the
    // keyboard view at least in 2 apps the keyboard editor and the keyboard
    // viewer used for testing. I think this UI couls also be used outside of
    // this project.

    // TODO: Rearchitect everything to remove the need for this callback.
    // The current API available to the caller to control the keyboard view
    // consists basically of changing the mode through 'commands'
    // (keyboard_view_commands_t). I now think this was a mistake. It makes the
    // keyboard view have basically 2 state machinse mixed together, the one
    // used for view editing commands, and the one to keep these caller states.
    // This second state machine really belongs in the caller, not inside the
    // keyboard_view. Comming up with a set of "modes" that would work in
    // general will be impossible and limit the caller somehow anyway. It also
    // makes us have callbacks like the following to notify the caller when a
    // mode does something they need to know about, this is not good. Callbacks
    // make things complicated because you don't really know WHEN this callback
    // will happen, and bugs can happen very easily if we start calling stuff in
    // the callback that may trigger another callback.
    //
    // What I want to do now, is turn everything inside out and take all this
    // state code into the caller and out of the keyboard view. This means the
    // following:
    //   - Remove keyboard_view_commands_t
    //   - Allow the caller to modify the rendered string of each key and their
    //     tooltip.
    //   - Allow the caller to set the color of individual keys.
    //   - Expose a function that takes x and y coordinates and returns the
    //     keycode of the key at that position.
    //   - Allow easy iteration thorugh all keys.
    //   - Make easy the common case where we 'move' the previously colored key.
    //
    // The reasons why this wasn't the straight forward thing to do before were:
    //   - Changing the rendering string per key implied keeping an allocated
    //     string per key struct and being able to modify it dynamically, with
    //     only pools this was not feasible. Now we have pooled string which
    //     make it easy to allocate/deallocate them.
    //   - There was no need to have multiple colors at the same time. But now
    //     to show types I do want to have multiple colors at the same time.
    //
    // As to how this implementation will look like I'm leaning towards just
    // exposing a kv_key_t struct where the user will store the data they want,
    // and have internally an array of them indexed by keycode, then when
    // rendering this data is looked up and things are rendered accordingly. I
    // had thought about adding functions for setting each thing internally, but
    // this seems more boilerplate code. This way also avoids duplicating
    // information in each segment, and confusing the caller about the concept
    // of segments.
